        <h1> About me</h1>
        <p> I’m Betelhem Sefiw who is studying software engineering at AASTU.
        Studying software engineering is very interesting, and I’m passionate 
        about learning more. I also participate in extracurricular activities like the 
        charity club, the women’s association and others. Currently I’m attending the GDG 
        program at our university. It is helping me a lot, and I’m gaining basic programming 
        knowledge because it mainly focuses on the practical skills. I want to attend the class 
        attentively and complete all the courses offered by the GDG program.
